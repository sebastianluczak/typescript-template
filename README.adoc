= TypeScript initial template

This is personal template to kickstart projects quickly in TS.

== Setup

[code]
====
git clone
npm install
npm start
====

Source code is located in ``./src``, build is done in ``./dist``.

== ``npm start`` magic

This command starts node in watch mode, so you can write TypeScript code
while watching resulting build of JavaScript code in console.
